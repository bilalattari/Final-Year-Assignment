    <h2>Desstructuring</h2>
    <p>
        Certainly! Hereâ€™s a paragraph explaining destructuring in JavaScript:
        
        Destructuring in JavaScript is a concise way to extract multiple values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables. By using destructuring, developers can write cleaner and more readable code. For arrays, destructuring allows you to pull out specific elements into variables with a simple syntax, avoiding the need for multiple indexing operations. For objects, destructuring enables the extraction of values by matching property names to variable names, facilitating the process of working with complex data structures. This feature enhances code clarity and reduces redundancy, making it easier to handle and manipulate data efficiently.</p>
