    <h1>What's Promise?</h1>
    <p>
      A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is
      created. It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's
      eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods
      return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning
      the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the
      value at some point in the future.
