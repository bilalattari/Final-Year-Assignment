    <h2>Promises</h2>
    <p>The Promise object supports two properties: state and result. While a Promise object is "pending" (working), the result is undefined. When a Promise object is "fulfilled", the result is a value. When a Promise object is "rejected", the result is an error object.</p><br>
    <p>In JavaScript, a Promise is a powerful object designed to handle asynchronous operations in a more manageable and organized manner compared to traditional callback-based methods. A Promise represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation, and it can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. The promise is created using the Promise constructor, which takes an executor function with resolve and reject parameters. The resolve function is called when the asynchronous operation completes successfully, passing the result, while the reject function is called when the operation fails, passing the error reason. Promises provide a cleaner syntax through methods like then, catch, and finally, which allow chaining and handling of asynchronous results. The then method specifies callbacks for success and failure, the catch method exclusively handles failures, and the finally method executes a callback once the promise is settled, regardless of its outcome. Additionally, static methods such as Promise.resolve, Promise.reject, Promise.all, and Promise.race offer further control, allowing the creation of immediately resolved or rejected promises and managing multiple promises simultaneously. This approach to handling asynchronous operations results in more readable and maintainable code, as demonstrated in examples where promises streamline complex operations with multiple asynchronous steps, ensuring a robust way to handle errors and results.
